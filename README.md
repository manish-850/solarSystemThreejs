# Solar System Simulation

This project is a **3D Solar System Simulation** built using **Three.js**. It visually represents the planets revolving around the Sun, complete with realistic textures, lighting, and orbital motion.

---

## Features

- Realistic 3D planets with textures.
- Orbiting motion for all planets and their moons.
- Point light acting as the **Sun** — the only light source.
- Smooth camera controls using **OrbitControls**.
- Scaled distances and rotation speeds for a natural effect.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Three.js** – 3D rendering engine.
- **Vite** – Build tool for fast development.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 & CSS3**

## How It Works

- The **Sun** is rendered using `MeshBasicMaterial` (so it glows without needing external light).
- A **PointLight** is placed at the Sun’s center to illuminate other planets.
- Each planet and moon is created from the same geometry but scaled based on realistic ratios.
- Orbits are simulated using trigonometric rotation around the Sun.
